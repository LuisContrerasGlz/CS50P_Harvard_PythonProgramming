# Implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines.
# f the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.
# Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a comment.) Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.
