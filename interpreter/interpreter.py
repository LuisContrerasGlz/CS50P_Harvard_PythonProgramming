# In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

# x is an integer
# y is +, -, *, or /
# z is an integer

# For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

# Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!

# Getting the input from the user
interp = input("What do you want to know? ")

# Taking the input from the user and make the variables
x, y, z = interp.split(" ")

# Converting the variables into floats
x_float = float(x)
z_float = float(z)

# Calculating the result of the operation

if y == "+":
    res = x_float + z_float
elif y == "-":
    res = x_float - z_float
elif y == "*":
    res = x_float * z_float
elif y == "/" and z != 0:
    res = x_float / z_float
else:
    print("ZeroDivisionError")

print(round(res,1))
